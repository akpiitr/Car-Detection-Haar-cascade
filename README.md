# Car-Detection-Haar-cascade
Here I have tried to use Haar cascade classifier to detect specifically moving cars.

After using Background Subtraction & as it didn't gave the accuracy which I could use to genrate some usefull results, I tried to use Haar Cascade classifier.

I have used Andrew's classifier "cars.xml" 

Belive me. results were much worse than my earlier approach.
